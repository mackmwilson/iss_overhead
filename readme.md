ISS Overhead Tracker
=================
This project is a simple International Space Station tracker that emails a user when the ISS is within 5 degrees latitude and longitude of the position specified and is visible (aka night time).

It uses the ISS location API and also a sunrise and sunset API to determine if the ISS is visible.

This project is based off Dr. Angela Yu's project in her 100 days of code series on Udemy.

Setting Up
=================
Download the code and add your latitude, longitude, and email information and run the code.  

It will check every 60 seconds whether the ISS is viewable at the location specified
